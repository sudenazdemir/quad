# Quad – ASCII Pattern Generator (01Edu Project)

Quad is a collection of Go programs that generate ASCII-based geometric patterns.  
Each file (quadA, quadB, quadC, quadD, quadE) produces a different type of border or shape design.  
The project focuses on algorithmic problem solving, pattern logic, and output formatting using Go.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Each program receives two integer arguments (width and height) and prints an ASCII pattern to the terminal.

**Example:**
```bash
go run . 5 3
```

**Output (quadA.go example):**
```
o---o
|   |
o---o
```

## 🗂️ Project Structure
```
quad/
│── go.mod
│── go.sum
│── quadA.go
│── quadB.go
│── quadC.go
│── quadD.go
│── quadE.go
```

Each file represents a different variation of the pattern logic:
- **quadA** → basic bordered rectangle  
- **quadB** → alternative corner symbols  
- **quadC / quadD / quadE** → extended logic for pattern generation

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Using loops and conditional logic in Go  
- Implementing modular functions for pattern drawing  
- Practicing ASCII output formatting and algorithmic reasoning  
- Strengthening fundamentals of Go syntax and logic flow

## 💡 Notes
This project was part of the 01Edu Go programming track.  
It helped develop strong control-flow logic and algorithmic design skills while working with multiple pattern variations.
